For the past few days I've been working through [Lazy Game Dev's](https://www.youtube.com/@LazyDevs) [SHMUP series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLea8cjCua_P3Sfq4XJqNVbd1vsWnh7LZd). I'm having a blast with [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

You don't have to have programmed before to follow along. These videos are a great way to get into programming. I've never wriitten [Lua](http://www.lua.org) before. I'm happy to report that it's been easy to pick up. Even if you're a seasoned dev I think you'll find a lot worth your time here. 

Porting [older React apps](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component) to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) isn't the most fun, but it pays the bills. The past few days working with [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) has recharged the batteries.
