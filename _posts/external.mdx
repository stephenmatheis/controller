This is a test post that links to Daring Fireball.

Here's a quote (emphasis mine):

> I got to spend about 30 minutes Monday afternoon using a **Vision Pro** and VisionOS at Apple Park, in a temporary _“field house”_ building Apple constructed specifically for this experience. This was a one-on-one guided tour with someone from the Vision product marketing team, with the ground rules that I’m allowed to talk about everything I experienced, but photos and videos were not permitted.
>
> It was a very fast 30 minutes, and the experience was, in a word, immersive. I’d pay good money just to run through the exact same 30 minutes again.
>
> It was nowhere near enough time, nor was I able to wander far off the rails of the prepared demos. It’s very clear that the OS and apps are far from finished. But even given the brevity of the demo and constraints of the current state of the software, there are a few things I feel confident about describing.
